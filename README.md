# Swarm-with-Turtle

Hello everybody,

Today I will present you something which is not really commun. Actually, I created something which looks like a bees swarm or a birds swarm. I will put you a photo for your understanding. I done that with Turtle, which is a Python's module, Turtle is on all Python's versions so you can run my programm without install nothing. Also, I use the Python module math, I used math because I needed to calculate the distance between two points. The programm is pretty easy to understand, it is short and fast. Don't hesitate t check my programm and maybe try to run it, I still work on Windows and sometimes with rpi4 with last version of Python.

Goodbye !
